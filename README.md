This was a once off script I created for my part-time job in a bike shop called Feel Good Bicycles.
In this repository, I created a python script to transfer data from our Lightspeed inventory POS system to the Woocommerce platform for our special limited-time deals site.

Project Highlights:

Efficient Data Conversion:
I faced the challenge of synchronizing our Lightspeed inventory with the Woocommerce platform. This required a robust data conversion tool that could handle the intricacies of product names, photos, descriptions, and item codes.

Python Script for Data Transformation:
The Python script was designed to convert and format data from Lightspeed into a structure compatible with Woocommerce. While the code may lack extensive comments and a polished structure, it perfectly serves its intended purpose.

Working with Large Datasets:
The project underscores my proficiency in handling extensive datasets efficiently. Converting and matching product details for a bike shop involves a vast amount of information, and this script successfully managed the task.

This repository shows off my ability to tackle real-world challenges even in my part-time job setting. While the script may have been created for a specific use case, it highlights my skills in data manipulation, scripting, and problem-solving using Python.
